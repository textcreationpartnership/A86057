            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

NEWES
From the
Kings Majeſties Royall Court at Cawſam;
Sent in a Letter from a Gentleman reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
at the Court, to his friend
in London.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOur laſt I have received, dated <hi>July</hi> 10
wherein I find many earneſt expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
touching the proceedings of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Treaty. And whereas you deſire to be a
partaker of our intelligence in theſe parts, I
ſhall here faithfully impart unto you, that
<pb facs="tcp:114341:3"/>
which is of greateſt concernmene, and moſt
deſired by the whole Kingdome, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings Majeſty doth not ſeeme (as yet) to alter
His Reſolution, or to remove His Court from <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam,</hi>
but is reſolved to ſtay there ſome certaine dayes
longer, in expectation and hopes of having the Duke of
<hi>Yorke,</hi> and the reſt of His Children ſent down to Him,
for the obtaining of which, the Generall hath ſent a
Letter to the Honourable Houſes of Parliament aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
at Weſtminſter, intimating the earneſt deſires
of his Majeſty therein; but (as yet) I do not heare
what anſwer hath been returned, concerning the ſaid
Deſires, expreſſed in his Excellencies Letter.</p>
            <p>But this much I can aſſure you, that the whole Court
in generall are prompt up with much confidence, and
do abſolute believe, that his Majeſties Deſires will bee
ſatisfied, and that his Children (whom he ſo earneſtly
deſire to ſee) will be ſpeedily ſent to him. Yet it is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
here, that the Parliament deſires a convenient
place may be appointed neerer <hi>London,</hi> to the intent,
His Majeſty may advance thither, for the viſiting of
his Children.</p>
            <p>But his Majeſty reſides here as yet, being gallantly
accomadated, in all reſpects whatſoever, which gives
great ſatisfaction and contentment to his Majeſty, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by the civill behaviour, and gallant expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of divers loyall and faithfull Subjects now atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his Royall Perſon; for ſeldome hath it <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>in ſeen,
(of late dayes) that his Majeſty was ever more mery
or lightſome then now, being joyfull to ſee his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
flock about Him, and doth not deny any one to
ſalute his Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114341:3"/>
Here is much reſorting to the Court, both from Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Towne, and Country, and many deſires to kiſſe His
Majeſties Hand: Divers are admitted into His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Chamber, and preſenting themſelves before him,
he puts forth his hand for them to kiſſe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty is very courteous and reſpective to all
that comes neer him, which cauſeth great tryumph and
joy throughout the whole Counties adjacent. He hath
within few dayes, touched abundance for the Kings E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and cured many.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty betakes himſelf much to Reading and
Study, and oftentimes confers with his two Chaplains
Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Shelden,</hi> who gives him
great ſatisfaction in many quaeries and Propoſals, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>As alſo, concerning divers ſcruples and objections,
touching the preſent Government of the Church of
England.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Richmond</hi> behaves himſelf very gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here, and the King takes great delight in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
And therefore for his Excellencies aſſenting &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mition
to have the ſaid Peer and two Chaplains come
to the Court (according to his Majeſties deſire) was a
a very honourable and prudent way: And according
to his Excellencies own words; That a moderate dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
towards His Majeſty, His Royall Family, and His
late Party, ſo farre as may ſtand with ſecurity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Rights, is the moſt hopefull courſe to take away
the Seeds of Warre amongſt Us for Poſterity, and to
procure a firme and laſting Peace; for the effecting
whereof, and for the propagation of the Goſpell of
Truth and Peace, it is hoped that neither the hearts of
Soveraign and Subjects will be wanting therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:114341:4"/>
Thus having given you a juſt Account (as neare as I

Kings Majeſty, I ſhall in the next place preſent to you
the Copy of a Proclamation, ſet forth by his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
